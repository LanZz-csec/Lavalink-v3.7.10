Hi, here is the **lavalink server** ready to run. 

## Ä°nfo

All you have to do is edit the `application.yml` file. I have listed the **important** areas you need to edit below.

``` 
port: 2333
address: 0.0.0.0 #If you're going to use it on localhost, keep it.
password: "youshallnotpass"
```


> Finally, open the file path with cmd and run the `java -jar Lavalink.jar` command.
